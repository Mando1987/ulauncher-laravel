# Contributing

There are no strict rules when contributing, but here are my suggestions.

> I use a combination of [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) and [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).

## Steps

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch depending on the issue that you are working on. *See reference table bellow.*
3. Do your work and commit.
4. Create a Pull Request to the `develop` branch.

### Branch naming reference

- `feature` - New functionality or refactoring.
- `bugfix` - Fixes existing code.
- `hotfix` - Urgent production fix. Use this if there is a huge bug.
- `support` - Documentation updates & stuff like that.
